## License
This project is subject to the [GNU General Public License v3.0](LICENSE). 

## Compiling
We can't release the decompiled source code of Minecraft in any way. Because of that, this repository only contains files added post decompilation. Although we don't have a proper manual, if you want to compile Elixe yourself, we added comments on methods (if needed) telling where you should modify external classes.
